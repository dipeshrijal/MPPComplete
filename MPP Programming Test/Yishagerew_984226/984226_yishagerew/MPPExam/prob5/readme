Here there are 2 possibilities solving the problem:
1. Adding a new interface and making Employee inherit from it, but this doesn't make sense as
every employee will not have bonus.
2. LeadEngineer and Manager has a bonus so, creating an interface for both of them and still use main information from
Employee class is an ideal choice.

Advantage of this design:
    Separation of concern, any employee should not be entitled to a BonusInterface interface
    Avoids duplication of code and otherwise be put in both classes, Manager and LeadEngineer


test:
    Main class is for testing the implementation, has main method for test!
